# The Rules of Chess
Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and eight columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares. The colors of the sixty-four squares alternate between light and dark, and are referred to as "light squares" and "dark squares". The chessboard is placed so that each player has a white square in the near right hand corner, and the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram, with each queen on a square that matches its color.

Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: each player's pieces comprise one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns. One player, referred to as White, controls the white pieces and the other player, Black, controls the black pieces; White is always the first player to move. The colors are chosen either by a friendly agreement, by a game of chance or by a tournament director. The players alternate moving one piece at a time (with the exception of castling, when two pieces are moved at the same time). Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square, or one occupied by an opponent's piece, capturing it and removing it from play. With one exception (en passant), all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.

## King

When a king is under direct attack by one (or possibly two) of the opponent's pieces, the player is said *to be in check*. When in check, only moves that remove the king from attack are permitted. The player must not make any move that would place his king in check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there are no moves that remove the king from attack.

The king can move only one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once in the game, each king is allowed to make a special double move, to castle. Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:

*The player must never have moved both the king and the rook involved in castling.
*There must be no pieces between the king and the rook.
*The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces. As with any move, castling is illegal if it would place the king in check.
*The king and the rook must be on the same rank (to exclude castling with a promoted carp).

## Queen

The queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.

## Rook

The rook moves any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally (it is also involved in the king's special move of castling).

## Elephant

The elephant may move two points diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color.

## Monkey

Monkeys moving rules are the same as the rook with one difference. In order to capture, the monkey has to jump over <s>only one</s> adjacent piece until there is none or until they captured a piece but it can be of either color.

## Carp

Carps have the most complex rules of movement: A carp can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not moved yet, the carp has the option of moving two squares forward, if both squares in front of the  carp are unoccupied. A carp cannot move backward. When such an initial two square advance is made that puts that carp horizontally adjacent to an opponent's carp, the opponent's carp can capture that carp *en passant* as if it moved forward only one square rather than two, but only on the immediately subsequent move. Carps are the only pieces that capture differently than they move. They can capture an enemy piece on either of the two spaces adjacent to the space in front of them (i.e., the two squares diagonally in front of them), but cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant. If a carp advances all the way to its eighth rank, it is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. In practice, the carp is almost always promoted to a queen.

# Timed Games

Games can be played with a time-limit by setting a move time when creating a new game. In timed games each player has a certain amount of time available for deciding which moves to make, and the time remaining for each player decreases only when it is their turn to move.

# Game Draw

A game that ends without victory for either player. Most drawn games are draws by agreement based upon the rules. The other ways that a game can end in a draw are stalemate, three-fold repetition, the fifty-move rule, and insufficient material. A position is said to be a draw (or a drawn position) if either player can, through correct play, eventually force the game into a position where the game must end in a draw, regardless of the moves made by the other player.

## Stalemate

A stalemate is a position in which the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and his king is not in check. A stalemate results in an immediate draw.

## Threefold repetetion

The game is drawn if the same position occurs three times with the same player to move, and with each player having the same set of legal moves each time (the latter includes the right to take en passant and the right to castle).

## Fifty move rule

The fifty move rule states that the game is drawn after fifty moves from each side without a pawn move or capture.

## Insufficient material

An endgame scenario in which all pawns have been captured, and one side has only its king remaining while the other is down to just a king or a king plus one knight or one bishop. The position is a draw because it is impossible for the dominant side to deliver checkmate regardless of play. Situations where checkmate is possible only if the inferior side blunders are covered by the fifty-move rule.
